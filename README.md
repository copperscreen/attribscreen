This is a retro-computing project. Beware!

This project allows you to configure an attributed screen and see how would static images look when displayed on it.
Chroma is set per attribute(makes sense given low color resolution of NTSC/PAL), luma is set per pixel (out of global luma palette). 
An attribute can also contain bits that chose between several luma palettes.

Drop the image on the page and see how it looks on the screen you've configured.

To run it type
```
npm install
npm run
```
